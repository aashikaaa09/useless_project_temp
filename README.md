### Project Description
This is a Mood Music Player, a chill space wherein you get to listen to songs NOT based on your mood ;) Just select how you're feeling  from the mood list, and it’ll pull up a "specially curated" Spotify playlist NOT for that exact mood.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Studies (that we didn't conduct and never intend to) show that unexpected songs can jolt you into a totally new state. Feeling calm? Time to rock out! Feeling heartbroken? Here’s a song about winning at life!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Ever wanted to experience every emotion within five minutes? Now you can! Our carefully un-curated playlists are scientifically unproven to take you on an emotional rollercoaster for maximum character building. Sad about a breakup? Here’s a motivational anthem. Feeling mellow? Let’s crank up the techno.
